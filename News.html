                <p>
                    A royal writer said that the Queen 'is getting older' and it was 'imperative for family unity' that the family came over to the UK for a visit, possibly in early December

                    Prince Harry and Meghan should visit the Queen with their new baby Lilibet as the US travel ban is no longer an 'excuse' a royal insider has claimed.
                </p>

                    A royal writer said that the Queen 'is getting older' and it was 'imperative for family unity' that the family came over.

                <p>
                    People who are fully vaccinated against Covid have been given the green light to travel to the US within weeks after President <span class="bold-red">Joe Biden</span> said he would lift the       <span class="bold-red">coronavirus</span> travel ban.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The White House announced that vaccinated passengers from the European Union and the UK will be able to enter the country from November.    
                </p>
                <p>
                    It marks the end of an 18-month blanket ban imposed by <span class="bold-red">Donald Trump</span> at the height of the Covid pandemic that has kept tourists, business people and separated families out.

                    In an interview <span class="bold-red">with The Sun</span> writer Adam Helliker said the brood returning to Harry's home country was "imperative for family unity."
                </p>
                <p>
                    He said: "I think Harry will feel particularly guilty if [the Queen] doesn't see the great-grandchildren she's not seen much of - or the great-granddaughter she's not seen at all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I think if they're going to try to patch things up - and we all hope they will work to increase what remains of the unity between them and the family - then I think it's paramount that they start planning a trip for maybe early December.

                    It comes after it was reported that <span class="bold-red"> Prince Harry </span> and <span class="bold-red">Meghan Markle</span> were desperate to see the Queen in order to maintain their "saleability in the United States."

                    Reports have suggested that the Sussexes could be keen to visit the UK so their three-month-old daughter Lilibet could be christened in Britain like her older brother Archie.

                <p>
                    Baby Lilibet has also never met <span class="bold-red">the Queen</span> after being born in California in June 2021, while Archie has been unable to see his great-grandmother since the family's move to the US at the beginning of 2020.
